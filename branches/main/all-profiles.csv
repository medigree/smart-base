","If the element must be supported","If true, implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL provide ""support"" for the element in some meaningful way.  If false, the element may be ignored and not supported. If false, whether to populate or use the data element in any way is at the discretion of the implementation.","""Something useful"" is context dependent and impossible to describe in the base FHIR specification. For this reason, tue mustSupport flag is never set to true by the FHIR specification itself - it is only set to true in profiles.  A profile on a type can always make musSupport = true if it is false in the base type but cannot make mustSupport = false if it is true in the base type.   This is done in [Resource Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#mustsupport), where the profile labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of ""support"" is required, as this can mean many things.    Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a ""key"" element (e.g. one of the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.","Allows a profile to set expectations for system capabilities beyond merely respecting cardinality constraints.","","In a base type, where the element is being defined for the first time, the element is assumed to be mustSupport = false. In a profile (a constraint on an existing type), if mustSupport is not specific in either the differentil or the snapshot, the mustSupport value is not changed fro the base definition. Not, though, that the snapshot SHOULD always populate the mustSuppot value","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"ElementDefinition.mustSupport",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","If this modifies the meaning of other elements","If true, the value of this element affects the interpretation of the element or resource that contains it, and the value of the element cannot be ignored.

The effect of this is that the element cannot be ignored by systems: they SHALL either recognize the element and process it, and/or a pre-determination has been made that it is not relevant to their particular system.","Only the definition of an element can set IsModifier true - either the specification itself or where an extension is originally defined. Once set, it cannot be changed in derived profiles. An element/extension that has isModifier=true SHOULD also have a minimum cardinality of 1, so that there is no lack of clarity about what to do if it is missing.
